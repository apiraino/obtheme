ObTheme is a GUI theme editor for openbox. Among its features are a live preview mode, a built-in xbm image button editor and a palette for changing colors globally. ObTheme has no connection to an older application of the same name.

ObTheme follows the Openbox theme specification at http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Themes.

This is a refactor of the original code by https://github.com/SRoader/obtheme, intended to modularize the codebase and ease the porting to Python3.
Pending task is porting from PyGTK to PyGObject (https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/PyGObject).

Configuration
=============

In openbox/theme_elements.py configure OPENBOX_CONFIG_FILE to point to your OpenBox theme file.
